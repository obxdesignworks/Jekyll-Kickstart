Description: A basic HTML5 skeleton for kickstarting Jekyll-based websites

I love Jekyll and I use it to build everything from static HTML prototypes to
small consumer websites and blogs. This is a simple skeleton to help me put
everything in place that I need to start a Jekyll project. 

I try not to make too many assumptions here other than the destination 
folder, but I did customize the nice .htaccess file that is provided with the 
HTML5 Boilerplate because it uses a lot of intelligent conventions. 
Other than that, hack away.

Cheers,
William Dodson
